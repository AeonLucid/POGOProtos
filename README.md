POGOProtos
===================

This repository contains the [ProtoBuf](https://github.com/google/protobuf) `.proto` files needed to decode the Pok√©monGo RPC.

If you want to know which messages are implemented right now, click [here](https://github.com/AeonLucid/POGOProtos/blob/master/src/POGOProtos/Networking/Requests/RequestType.proto).

# Usage

## Preparation

Current recommended protoc version: "Protocol Buffers v3.0.0-beta-4".

You can find download links [here](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases).

### Windows
Be sure to add `protoc` to your environmental path.

### *nix
Ensure that you have the newest version of `protoc` installed.

### OS X
Use `homebrew` to install `protobuf ` with `brew install --devel protobuf`.

## Compilation
There are two ways to compile **POGOProtos**.

### Single file compilation (Recommended)
Single file compilation merges every directory to it's own `.proto` file.
As an example:

 - Networking/Requests/Messages/*.proto
 - Networking/Responses/*.proto

Becomes:

 - POGOProtos.**Networking.Requests.Messages.proto**
 - POGOProtos.**Networking.Responses.proto**

These new files are then compiled by `protoc` and placed in the output directory. This greatly reduces the amount of output files.

#### Command

Run `python compile_single.py` to compile everything to a single file.

#### Flags

 - Add the `-l` or `--language` flag to compile to whatever language you need, the default is C#.
 - Add the `-o` or `--output` flag to set an output directory, the default is `out`.
 - Add the `-d` or `--desc_file` flag to only generate a descriptor file, `POGOProtos.desc` will be written to the specified output directory.

### Recursive compilation

Recursive compilation loops through all directories and compiles every `.proto` file it finds to the specified output directory.

#### Command

Run `python compile.py` to recursively compile everything.

#### Flags

 - Add the `-l` or `--language` flag to compile to whatever language you need, the default is C#.
 - Add the `-o` or `--output` flag to set an output directory, the default is `out`.
